shell command stub

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/shtub/shtub.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/shtub/shtub)

Integration test framework which allows to *stub shell commands*: if you have to assure that your *legacy code* is still calling the same shell commands as it did before your changes.

The framework uses stubs for command executions, whose actions are verified against expectations.
